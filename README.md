Instructions:
Requires JDK 20. Run with `java -jar bowling-score-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` from root folder.

Some notes:
- I could've just skipped all the validations, object oriented code, test, etc, but this is how I code.
- I write code that tries to explain the domain though it may be more verbose.
- Creating test data was difficult, but now I feel I understand bowling quite well.

Improvements:
- Could have more structured tests with better descriptions and more edge cases.
- Not sure if the std dev formula was correct.
- I could use streams a lot more.
- Could've used more than one type of exception, but if you think about it, all exceptions are StateExceptions.
